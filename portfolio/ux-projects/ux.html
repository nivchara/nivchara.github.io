                    <p>Wow, one year since I created this mockup and I am still amazed at what I was able to accomplish back then! I still love this idea and think it would work, especially with the rise of cat cafes across the country. <br> I like the simple
                        design of my app and how it is not too differently formatted from other apps I see on the market. The name is cute and memorable and there was a good amount of research done from both real people and personas. <br>Reflecting on
                        what I made, I would like to see this app become more accessible to users. For example, on-click triggers a color change or animation to give visual feedback to the user on their input. <br>Additionally now that I have taken a
                        front-end web developer program, I would like to see this app potentially as a responsive website to make it available to a wider audience and implement search engine optimization. <br>Overall, it is very nostalgic to see my first
                        UX project and be able to look back on it with a more developed understanding of both UX and web development.
