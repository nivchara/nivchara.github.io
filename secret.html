    <h1>Secret Page!</h1>
    <p>Oh hey, you found my secret page! Either you know how to inspect this website, or I gave you the link to get feedback on the design. Either way, welcome!</p><br>
    <p>Since you made it this far, you deserve some fun facts about me, because I didn't think anyone would get this far tbh.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My favorite ice cream flavor is mint chip with pineapple topping</li>
        <li>My favorite tea is what I like to call the "Minty Mango Express", which is mint tea with mango tea and a shit ton of sugar.</li>
        <li>I really like bees.</li>
        <li>I learned how to program because those less competent than me were able to do it</li>
        <li>I also really wanted to understand coding memes</li>
    </ul>
